# Typewriter to keyboard

Got an old typewriter from my grandmother, had in mind to turn it into a keyboard. This finally sort of worked for most of the characters. 

Next steps would be to make some characters more reliable (such as spacebar for example), due to the way the typewriter is made; as well as wrapping all this in a driver (for now this can only write in the serial monitor).
