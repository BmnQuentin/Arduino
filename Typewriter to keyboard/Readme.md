# Typewriter to keyboard

Got an old typewriter from my grandmother, had in mind to turn it into a keyboard. This finally sort of worked for most of the characters. 

Technically, this mainly uses a membrane potentiometer (ex here: https://coolcomponents.co.uk/products/softpot-membrane-potentiometer-200mm) that reacts to the metallic bars of the keys being raised, each hitting in a different area of the potentiometer.

Next steps would be to make some characters more reliable (such as spacebar for example), due to the way the typewriter is made; as well as wrapping all this in a driver (for now this can only write in the serial monitor).
