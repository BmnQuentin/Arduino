# Projects for my cat

Different projects i tried to entertain my cat who appears to be my main source of inspiration. I think they finally all failed in some cat-related way...

## Laser for cat
This project has been stopped because it caused the cad to be completely lost and frustrated afterwards, which was pretty sad. Tried to change the laser with a physical game directly moved by the servomotor but this caused the whole installation to be destroyed after first game. Guess that still needs mechanical improvement.

## Cat feeder
The idea was to entertain the cat as well as feeding her while we were gone, but the whole system seemed to scare her. PLus this may need a bit more robust mechanism, since it seems to get stuck every once in a while.

## Cat fountain
The idea here was to give the cat some running water being pumped from a bucket when we were gone for the weekend since she doesn't like to drink from a bowl. She never fully grasped the principle and was afraid every time the pump started to run...
